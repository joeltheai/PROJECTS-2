   But not even a violent person who had once rescued a famous puppy from a burning building, was prepared for what Forest had in store today.

The sleet rained like sleeping blue bottles, making Joshua lonely. Joshua grabbed a damp gun that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As Joshua stepped outside and Forest came closer, she could see the uptight glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want revenge," Forest bellowed, in a caring tone. She slammed her fist against Joshua's chest, with the force of 922 flamingos. "I frigging hate you, Joshua Bond."

Joshua looked back, even more lonely and still fingering the dude.
